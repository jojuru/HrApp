The purpose of the program is to be an application that can manage a company's personnel information. In addition to personal information, the program also includes details about employees' employment relationships. The program consists of two pages: a login page and the main page.

The login page is specifically for logging in, and it also includes a feature to add a new user by pressing a button located below the password field. The main page has sections for personnel and their related employment relationships. In the application, you can add, modify, view, and delete information about personnel and their employment relationships.

The application has many other features as well. For example, personal information and their employment details are encrypted when they are stored in a text file. The program logs all events, suggests cities based on the entered postal code, and even checks that the social security number is valid.

The application has been developed using Visual Studio with .NET MAUI. The programming languages used are C# and XAML.
